# To Do List - ReactNative
Goal: Create a simple To Do List app with React Native

## Objectives
1. Practice setting up dependencies
2. Learn how to create a stylized front-end in React Native
3. Learn how to pass props
4. Learn how to manage state in React Native

## Accomplished
âœ… **Practice setting up dependencies**
* Creating a new project was really straightforward: `expo init todoList`
* doing things a second time is so much easier and smoother than the first time
  * `expo` CLI was already installed
  * `npm` was already updated
  * Expo Go client was already set up on my smartphone for immediate deployment and testing
