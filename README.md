# To Do List - ReactNative
Goal: Create a simple To Do List app with React Native

## Objectives
1. Practice setting up dependencies
2. Learn how to create a stylized front-end in React Native
3. Learn how to pass props
4. Learn how to manage state in React Native

## ✅ Practice setting up dependencies
**What I Learned:**
* Creating a new project was really straightforward: `expo init todoList`
* doing things a second time is so much easier and smoother than the [first time](https://github.com/Anish-Sinha/HelloWorld-ReactNative)
  * `expo` CLI was already installed
  * `npm` was already updated
  * Expo Go client was already set up on my smartphone for immediate deployment and testing
  
## ✅ Create a stylized front-end in React Native
There are 2 essential aspects for a To Do list: 
1. Be able to create new tasks
2. Be able to manage existing tasks

I first began with designing a very rough but very simple UI that allows a user to easily create new tasks and manage (e.g. update, delete) existing tasks. The following design of the app and the *Task Elements* should allow the user to accomplish both with as few user taps as possible. We'll see how this hypothesis holds as we develop the app.

**UI / UX Progression**\
Here is the evolution of how the UI of the To Do List emerged and developed over time:
